<p>Biomolecular condensates have both viscous and elastic properties. To measure the viscous and elastic moduli of these condensates, they are allowed to settle with carboxylated polystyrene beads partitioned in them. A bead in a particular condensate is then trapped and oscillated at a particular frequency within the condensate. The trap position and calibrated force signal data is analyzed by the current script to obtain the the viscous and elastic moduli at the operation frequency.</p><p><br></p><p>Simply run the script with the h5 file containing the oscillation data in the same folder. Details on the operation of the experiment can be obtained here:</p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26274-z<br></p><br><br>
