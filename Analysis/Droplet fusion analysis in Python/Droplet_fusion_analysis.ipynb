    "## Analyzing a droplet fusion event\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in this notebook were acquired by moving two fluorescently labeled RNA droplets together at a constant speed. The droplets were held by optical tweezers and the right tweezers is moving while the left one is static. As the droplets come close together, they fuse to form one, larger droplet. The relaxation time of the fusion event, 𝜏, together with the radii of the droplets can reveal something about the material properties of the droplets; when plotting 𝜏 vs the average droplet radius for many droplets, the slope is given by 𝜂/𝛾, viscosity (Pa*s) /surface tension (N/m), assuming a Newtonian fluid 1. The ratio 𝜂/𝛾 is also known as the inverse capillary velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the PSD signal (usually used to determine force exerted by the optical tweezers) and a scan were recorded during the experiment. The PSD signal has a much higher time resolution than the images, therefore it is best to use PSD signal to determine the relaxation time of the fusion event. In this Notebook, we will first obtain the relaxation time from the PSD signal and then estimate the size of the droplets from the scan.\n",
