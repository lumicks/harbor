<h1>Effective kon from a kymograph</h1><br>

<br>
<p>This Notebook contains a full example analysis workflow for determining the effective on-rate, k'<sub>on</sub> (the inverse of the binding time in Figure 1) for proteins binding to a target site. The on-rate is determined by tracking the duration of binding events of a fluorescently labeled protein on a kymograph, and determining the intervals between the binding events. The intervals are then collected and fitted to an exponential distribution to determine k'<sub>on</sub> .
