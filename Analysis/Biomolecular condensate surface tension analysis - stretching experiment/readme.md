<h1>Biomolecular condensate surface tension analysis - stretching experiment</h1><br>
<b>Author</b>: Archishman Ghosh<br>
<b>Key words</b>: active microrheology, Droplets, surface tension<br>
<b>Research subjects</b>: Phase separation<br>
<br>
<p>A biomolecular condensate is stretched between two optically trapped carboxylate coated polystyrene beads. The trap position and the calibrated force signal from the two traps are then analyzed using the following script to obtain the surface tension.</p><p><br></p><p>Details of the experiment can be found in:</p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26274-z<br></p><br><br>
