<p>Single-Molecule Force Spectroscopy Toolkit (SMFST), a powerful tool used to study Force spectroscopy data. It’s a MATLAB-based software with a friendly graphical interface and efficient processing. The toolkit can be used for analyzing Force-Extension curves collected by different technologies and extended for new mathematical models in the future.</p><br>
<p>When using our software in a research project, there is no need to list us as the corresponding author of the article, just mention it explicitly in the acknowledgements section.</p><br>
<p>We are constantly optimizing and upgrading the software, so please contact us if you would like to get the latest version of the software.</p><br>
