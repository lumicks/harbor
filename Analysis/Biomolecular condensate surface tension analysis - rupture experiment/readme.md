<p>Biomolecular condensates with carboxylate coated polystyrene beads partiitioned within them are allowed to settle. Then the bead is optically trapped and forced out of the condensate by rupturing the surface of the droplet. The rupture profile given by the force trace is analyzed by the current script to obtain the surface tension.</p><p><br></p><p>Details of the experiment can be found here:</p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26274-z<br></p><br><br>
