<h1>Protein binding lifetime from kymograph</h1><br>

<br>
<p>This Notebook contains a full example analysis workflow for determining the duration of binding of a protein to DNA. The binding lifetime is determined by tracking the duration of binding events of a fluorescently labeled protein on a kymograph, as illustrated in the figure below. The durations are then collected and fitted to an exponential distribution to determine the binding lifetime.
