<b>Key words</b>: Droplet fusion, Video analysis, Stretched exponential, Edge to edge distance<br>
<b>Research subjects</b>: Phase separation<br>
<br>
<p>The video captured in BlueLake is first imported in ImageJ. On the ImageJ thereafter:</p><p>1. Crop around the fusion droplets.</p><p>2. Enhance contrast or sharpen if needed.</p><p>3. Export as image series with time stamps as names.</p><p>Put exported images in a folder and download the two scripts in that folder. Execute fusiondist in MATLAB with a certain threshold value between 0 to 1. A typical value depends on the brightness of the LED. 0.2-0.3 is standard.</p><p>The program will calculate edge to edge distance and fit it to a stretched exponential function.</p><p>Details in:&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202006711">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202006711</a>​</p><p>​</p><br><br>
