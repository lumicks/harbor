<h1>Piezo tracking: Hairpin unfolding</h1><br>
<b>Author</b>: Aafke van den Berg<br>
<b>Key words</b>: Piezo tracking<br>
<b>Research subjects</b>: Protein folding<br>
<br>
<p>These files contain instructions and a script to compute the piezo distance.</p><p>The piezo distance is the distance between beads, calculated from the Trap 1 position and the displacements of the beads from the bead centers.&nbsp;</p><p>The piezo distance provides a higher time resolution and can be used up to smaller distances than the camera tracking distance. The piezo distance is therefore often used for protein unfolding experiments with short tethers.&nbsp;</p><p>The example used here is one of a DNA hairpin</p><br><br>
