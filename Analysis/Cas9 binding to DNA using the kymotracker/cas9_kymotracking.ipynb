    "Now that we’ve loaded some data, we can begin tracking lines on it. For this, we open the widget. This will provide us with a view of the kymograph and some dials to tune in algorithm settings. We open with a custom `axis_aspect_ratio` which determines our field of view. This input is not necessary, but provides a better view of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the greedy algorithm. For more information on how it works, please refer to the [Pylake kymotracking tutorial](https://lumicks-pylake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/cas9_kymotracking/../../tutorial/kymotracking.html#track-greedy). The `threshold` should typically be chosen somewhere between the expected baseline photon count and the photon count of a true track (note that you can see the local photon count between square brackets while hovering over the kymograph). The `track width` should roughly be set to the expected spot size (in the spatial dimension) of a track. The `window` should be chosen such that small gaps in a track can be overcome, but not so large that spurious points may be strung together as a track. `Sigma` controls how much the location can fluctuate from one time point to the next, while the `min length` determines how many peak points should be in a track for it to be considered a valid track. The optional `adjacency_filter` removes detections that have no detections in their neighboring frame (prior to tracking) which can cut down on noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holding down the left mouse button and dragging pans the view, while the right mouse button allows us to drag a region where we should perform tracking. Any track which overlaps with the selected area will be removed before tracking new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The icon with the little square can be used to toggle zoom mode, which will allow you to zoom in one subsection of the kymograph. Clicking it again brings us back out of zoom mode. You can zoom out again by clicking the home button. Quite often, it is beneficial to find some adequate settings for track all, and then fine-tune the results using the manual rectangle selection. It’s not mandatory to use the same settings throughout the kymograph. For example, if you see a particular event where two tracks are disconnected but should be connected, temporarily increase the window size and just drag a rectangle over that particular track while having the option `Track` enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s do some tracking. There are two ways to approach this analysis. The first is to just use the rectangle selection, which can be quite time intensive. Alternatively, you can use `Track All` to simply track the entire kymograph, and then remove spurious detections by hand. This can be good to get a feel for the parameters as well. If we select the `Remove Tracks` mode we will start removing tracks without grabbing new ones. This functionality can be used to remove spurious detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you wish to connect two tracks in the kymograph manually, you can switch to the `Connect Tracks` mode. In this mode you can click a point in one track with the right mouse button and connect it to another by dragging to a point in the track you wish to connect it to.\n",
