<pre>This code could be used for the analysis of the cell membrane force measurement obtained using three steps. The goal is to export the force corresponding to the last stage of the experiment. <br>This codes reads the force measurement file (.h5) which includes three stage of the experiments (approaching+pausing+detaching)<br><br>This code identifies the last step of the experiment (detaching) and exports the data correlating to this step as an excel file</pre><br><br>
