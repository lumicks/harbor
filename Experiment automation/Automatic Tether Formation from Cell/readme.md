<p>This script is written to help automation of creating a tether from the cell membrane. If you have cells adhered to the surface and you want to create a tether from the membrane and measure the membrane tension, you can use this code.&nbsp;</p><p>This code includes 3 steps of tether formation:</p><p>Step 1: moving the nano-stage toward the bead to create the contact between the cell membrane and the bead&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: This step might be performed manually<br></p><p>Step 2: pausing for a few seconds to make sure the contact has been formed and bead is attached to the cell</p><p>Step 3: moving the nano-stage away from the bead for a specific length</p><p>This code is for the movement in x direction.&nbsp;</p><br><br>
