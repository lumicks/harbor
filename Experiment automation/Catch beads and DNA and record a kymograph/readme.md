<b>Author</b>: Aafke van den Berg<br>
<b>Key words</b>: Kymograph, fluorescence, DNA<br>
<b>Research subjects</b>: DNA-binding proteins<br>
<br>
<p>The script follows the following steps: <br></p><div>1) Catch beads<br>2) Catch a DNA tether<br>3) Check if it is only a single tether, if not, try to break tethers until there is 1 left.<br>4) Move using the microstage to 'J1' at 80% speed<br>5) Move using the microstage to protein channel at 80% speed<br>6) Stretch the tether to a force of 40 pN<br>7) Wait 5s to allow proteins to bind.<br>8) Start a kymograph.<br>9) The first 10s, leave the tension at 40 pN<br>10) The next ~ 20s, move from 20 pN to 40 pN in 5pN steps<br>11) Stop the kymograph.</div><br><br>
