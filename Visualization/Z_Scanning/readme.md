<p>This code creates a stack of images (a video) by doing z-Scanning. You need to set the scan setting and run the script. The script enables scanning a plane and moves the to the next z-plane. This cycle goes one for your desired number of the planes.&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>NOTICE: please be mindful of the total height you are scanning. Nanostage should not move too high to hit the condenser.<br></p><br><br>
