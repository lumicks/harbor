<p>This script makes a video with the edge to edge distance of two fusing droplets annotated in microns.</p><p>he video captured in BlueLake is first imported in ImageJ. On the ImageJ thereafter:</p><p>1. Crop around the fusion droplets.</p><p>2. Enhance contrast or sharpen if needed.</p><p>3. Export as image series with time stamps as names.</p><p>Put exported images in a folder and download the script in that folder. Execute fusionvideo in MATLAB with a certain threshold value between 0 to 1 and your desired framerate. A typical value of threshold depends on the brightness of the LED. 0.2-0.3 is standard.</p><p>The program will calculate edge to edge distance and annotate on each image and make a video out of it in the same folder.</p><p>Details in:&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202006711">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202006711</a></p><br><br>
