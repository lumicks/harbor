## About

Harbor is the script sharing platform for the [C-Trap](https://lumicks.com/dsm-overview/). Search for analysis and automation scripts that fit your application, or upload your script, to share it with other C-Trap users.

## Adding your script

When adding a script to the Harbor repository, please make sure to share the following information:
- We recommend copy-pasting the [BSD-2-Clause](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-2-clause) at the top of your script, which explains under what conditions your script can be shared.
- The title of your script
- The experimental phase (i.e. Analysis, Experiment Automation or Visualization).
- Who you'd like to be attributed as an author
- (Optional) Images to support the description of the script
- (Optional) A few of keywords related to your script

To share the information above and your script, follow one of these options:

### Option 1 (Easy)

Send a zip file with your script and the information listed above to harbor@lumicks.com and we will add it to our public Github repository.

### Option 2 (Easy)
If you already added your script to your personal Github repository, you can send us the information above and the link to the folder on your repository containing the script.
We will add the link and description in a README file, such that C-Trap users can find their way to your repository. 

### Option 3 (Pro)

If you did not add the script to your personal repository but are familiar with git, please feel free to open a Pull Request to add your script.

## Downloading scripts

Browse the folders to search for scripts that fit your application. Some scripts are included in the Harbor repository and can be downloaded directly. Other folders will contain a link to the repository of the developer of the script. You can then download the script there. Some scripts have been published, please make sure to cite the corresponding paper when using the script.
